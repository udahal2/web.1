# What Happened When You Ran yarn install?

    Yarn Installation:

        You ran yarn install in your project directory. This command reads the package.json and yarn.lock files to install all the dependencies listed in them.

        Yarn resolved, fetched, and linked the dependencies, and then built the project.

    Peer Dependency Warning:

        You got a warning: "openapi-client-axios@7.5.5" has unmet peer dependency "js-yaml@^4.1.0". This means the openapi-client-axios package expects js-yaml version 4.1.0 or higher to be installed, but itâ€™s not currently installed. You might want to install it manually using yarn add js-yaml@^4.1.0.

    Husky Installation:

        The husky install script ran after the dependencies were installed. Husky is a tool for managing Git hooks. It sets up pre-commit or pre-push hooks to enforce code quality checks (like linting or testing) before commits or pushes.

    Project Structure:

        After running yarn install, your project directory now contains all the necessary files and folders for the project to run. These include:

            Configuration files (.babelrc, .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc.js, etc.).

            Source code folders (app, docs, public, src-tauri, etc.).

            Dependency folders (node_modules).

            Git-related files (.github, .husky, .gitignore).

            Build and deployment scripts (build.ps1, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml).

Project Overview

This appears to be a full-stack web application with the following characteristics:

    Frontend: Likely built with Next.js (evidenced by next.config.mjs).

    Backend: Possibly a Node.js backend (evidenced by package.json and yarn.lock).

    Tauri Integration: The presence of src-tauri suggests this project might be using Tauri, a framework for building lightweight desktop applications using web technologies.

    Testing: Includes Jest for testing (jest.config.ts, jest.setup.ts).

    Linting and Formatting: Uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

    Docker Support: Includes Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization.

    Git Hooks: Uses Husky for pre-commit checks.

# setup instructions:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
yarn install
yarn dev
yarn test
# deployement
docker-compose up --build

# Troubleshooting

Unmet Peer Dependency: If you see warnings about unmet peer dependencies, install the required versions manually. For example:
bash
Copy

yarn add js-yaml@^4.1.0

Husky Issues: If Git hooks arenâ€™t working, reinstall Husky:
bash
Copy

yarn husky install

### **Next Steps**

1. Run the project using `yarn dev` or `yarn start`.
2. If you encounter any issues, refer to the `README_DEEPSEEK.md` file for troubleshooting.
3. Install any missing peer dependencies (e.g., `js-yaml`).
